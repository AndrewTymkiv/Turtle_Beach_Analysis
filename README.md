#### Interest Expenses

- Between 2014-2019, Turtle Beach's total cash & short-term investments were reported between $5-$8M. In 2020, the company reported a large increase with $47M in total cash and short-term investments.

## Additional Factors
- Currently priced at over $27, Turtle Beach does not seem to be overvalued with a P/E ratio of 8.6
- Additionally, the company's PEG ratio is 0.5 suggesting it could potentially be undervalued at the moment.
- Looking at consumer behaviour, there is one important factor to be weary of when considering Turtle Beach's potential growth. The company's sole focus is video gaming accesories, mainly good quality headsets. They had a very strong year financially in 2020 during the pandemic, but this is likely due to people staying home and spending more time on home entertainment products such as video games. It is fair to hypothesize that the pandemic forcing people to stay at home led to more people playing video games, and was a main factor in the company's increased revenue for the year. With vaccinations underway around the world and economies opening back up, it is worth questioning whether or not the demand for Turtle Beach's products will decrease as people begin to spend less time in their homes.
